        <p>Welcome to my portfolio site! My name is Aljaž, and I am a self-taught frontend web developer with a passion for creating beautiful, user-friendly websites and web apps.</p>
        <p>After working in a different field, I decided to pursue my dream of becoming a frontend web developer. I am motivated, driven, and willing to learn whatever it takes to succeed in this exciting and fast-paced industry. I believe that with hard work, dedication, and a strong commitment to learning, anything is possible.</p>
        <p>On my portfolio page, you will find examples of my work, including websites and apps I have designed and built from scratch. Every project contains links to its GitHub repo and live page.</p>
